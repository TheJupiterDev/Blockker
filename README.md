# Blockker

A tool for easily creating custom blocks using Minecraft Datapacks.
**Only Supported for 1.21.3 and up! No previous versions will be added!**

## How to use
_Exe builds will release when the project comes out of beta._
You need Python 3.13.0 and PyQt5 (pip install PyQt5)
Download the code, and run main.py. 
Fill in all the details, press "Generate Pack" when you are ready.
Note that this will not work properly if you do not have a resource pack properly set up for it.

### Known Issues
None now! I fixed them all :)

The tool was made entirely by me, but the method for adding custom blocks was developed by https://youtube.com/@WASDBuildTeam and improved upon by me!
