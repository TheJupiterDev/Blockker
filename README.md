# Blockker
A tool for easily creating custom blocks using Minecraft Datapacks.

## How to use
You need Python 3.12.* and PyQt5 (pip install PyQt5)
Download the code, and create a folder titled `output` in the root directory.
Run main.py. Fill in all the details, press "Generate Pack" when you are ready.

### Known Issues
Removing blocks is not yet supported (though the UI is in place.)
The `description` field does not do anything, this will be changed in the future.



The tool was made entirely by me, but the method for adding custom blocks was developed by WASD Build Team!
